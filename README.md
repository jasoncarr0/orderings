# orderings

<h2>What is this for</h2>
This is here to support some non-total orderings and some operations with pone-sided bounds. Some types may support a partial or preorder, or may have a total order but have only a one-sided bound (e.g. [a] has a lower bound [], but no upper bound). Enum instances for types like Enum a => Enum [a] can be included that are missing in prelude.

<h2>Why are you making this</h2>
I couldn't find something similar, and wanted certain typeclasses/instances for other code, so I'd rather wrap it up in one simple code block that I can reference.

<h2>When are you going to finish this</h2>
Eventually. It's not particularly difficult, but I'm not nearly as productive as I should be, and have studies and other things to deal with. Feel free to help if you can do anything / do anything better than me
